//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ["Aladdin","Lion King","Inside Out"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let favorite = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let large = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable.
// What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? 
// Would your solution still work?

let lastmov = movies[movies.length - 1]
