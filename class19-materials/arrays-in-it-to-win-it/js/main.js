//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let favMovies = ["Lion King", "Aladdin", "Interestellar"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let firstMovie = favMovies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let lengthVar = favMovies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable.
// What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? 
// Would your solution still work?

let lastElement = favMovies[favMovies.length -1]
